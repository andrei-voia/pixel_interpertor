# Pixel Pnterpertor

* Interpreting, with pixel accuracy, images that you want to convert into text and information.
* This code can be used to make some world convertion for games or other projects.

## Before convertion

This is how the image looked like before the convertion:

And after the convertion:

## More functionality

Another thing you can do with this code is margin softness. This means that when 2 different pixels intersect, you can replace them with a combination of the two. 
* The program can also detect when there is a corner too between 2 textures
